        This Chicken Biryani is a classic Hyderabadi-style recipe. Layered with tender marinated chicken, fragrant basmati rice, crispy onions, herbs and saffron milk. It’s cooked low and slow using the traditional dum method to lock in all the flavour. A proper crowd-pleaser and perfect for a weekend cook-up.

<h2>
    Directions
</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Fry the onions</strong><br>
        Heat enough oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat to shallow fry the sliced onions in batches until golden brown. Keep a close eye on them, as they crisp up quickly. Set aside.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Marinate the chicken</strong><br>
        In a large pot (Dutch oven), add the chicken, yoghurt, chilli powder, turmeric, garam masala, ginger paste, garlic paste, lemon juice, 1 green chilli sliced thin, 1 cinnamon stick, 8 lightly crushed green cardamom pods, 1 tsp cumin seeds, 4 cloves, 1 tsp salt, half of the chopped mint, half of the coriander, and one-third of the fried onions. Mix well until the chicken is fully coated. Cover and marinate in the fridge for 4–24 hours.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Prepare the rice</strong><br>
        About one hour before the chicken is ready, rinse the rice twice and soak it in water for 40 minutes.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Make the saffron milk</strong><br>
        Add the warmed milk to a small bowl, stir in the saffron threads gently, and set aside to steep.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Cook the rice</strong><br>
        Bring a large pot of water to a boil and season with 1 tbsp salt, 6 green cardamom pods, 1 green chilli sliced lengthways, 1 cinnamon stick, 2 cloves, and 1 tsp cumin seeds. Drain the soaked rice and add it to the pot. Cook for 4–6 minutes until the rice is just cooked but still has a slight bite. Drain and set aside.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Cook the chicken</strong><br>
        Place the marinated chicken pot over high heat and cook for 4–6 minutes, stirring every 1–2 minutes. Turn off the heat and remove half of the chicken along with some sauce. Spread the remaining chicken evenly in the pot.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Layer the biryani</strong><br>
        Spread half of the rice evenly over the chicken in the pot. Add the reserved chicken on top, followed by a layer of crispy onions and half of the remaining mint and coriander. Repeat with the remaining rice, crispy onions, and herbs. Drizzle the saffron milk evenly over the top.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Seal and cook</strong><br>
        Cover the pot with a lid and seal it using a tea towel or dough seal. Cook on medium-high heat for 10 minutes, then reduce to very low heat and cook for another 30 minutes.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Rest and serve</strong><br>
        Remove from heat and let the biryani rest for 20 minutes before opening the lid. Garnish with any remaining herbs and serve.
